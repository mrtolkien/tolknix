# WORKSPACE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Workspace assignments per monitor. This setup uses:
# - Workspaces 1-10 for DP-2 (primary monitor)
# - Workspaces 11-20 for HDMI-A-1 (secondary monitor)
#
# This works with workspace_action.sh script for intelligent workspace switching.
# CUSTOMIZE monitor names to match your setup (see monitors.conf).
